# **News Scraper:**

### **Project Description:**

An app that scrapes article titles on an existing blog or news site, stores the data in a mongo db, and allows for user comments on each article.

### **Getting Started:**

Check out the deployed version here: https://news-scraper38.herokuapp.com/

### **How to Use:**

If there are already pre-scraped articles, then they will be displayed on the left side of the page under the article list. You can click each article title to see a previous comment left by a user. If you wish to check for new article titles from the website, then go to the article search page and click the search button. Once webpage has been scraped, then any new article titles will be added to the list of existing titles in the article list column.

### **Prerequisites:**

Mongodb Server

### **Installing:**

If you wish to use the app locally, then clone the repo on your computer. Ensure that you have an instance of Mongodb database running on your computer. In the command line of Command Prompt or Git Bash, while in the base folder of the app directory, type "npm install". Once all the packages are installed, type "npm start" to initiate the app.
